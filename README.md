<h3>Introduction</h3>
Sign language, whether it be American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), or various other regional and custom sign languages, serves as a vital means of communication for millions of individuals around the world. However, the efficacy of sign language communication has long been limited by the divide between the signing community and those who are not fluent in sign languages. Bridging this gap through technology is not just a matter of convenience; it has profound implications for the inclusion and accessibility of individuals with 
hearing impairments, fostering greater societal integration and equal opportunities.

Sign language is a way to express feelings and thoughts, but not everyone understands it. The person who are unable to hear and speak use their hands and body to communicate that’s what is sign language. That's where our project comes in. We are working on project that can understand sign language. It's like a translator who can instantly turn sign language into words and vice versa.

Our goal is to make communication easier for people who are deaf and can’t hear to anyone and for the people who can’t understand their language to the deaf people. Hence, it is helpful for both who use sign language and who don’t. With our project, sign language users can talk to anyone, and anyone can understand them. It's all about breaking down communication barriers and making the world a more inclusive place. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to express themselves and be heard, no matter how they communicate. That's why Vibe Speak is social welfare project.
